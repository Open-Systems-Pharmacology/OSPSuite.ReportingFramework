Description: The OSPSuite Reporting Framework, which is based on the esqlabsR package, 
    is a robust tool designed to systematically define simulation scenarios, their inputs and outputs,
    and standardize data import and matching processes. 
    These functionalities allow for easy and automatable model execution and plot generation, 
    ultimately facilitating the generation of customizable reports for 
    OSP physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models. 
    As a result, this framework significantly enhances reporting efficiency, 
    enabling researchers to create clear, tailored reports that effectively communicate complex modeling results.
